<h2>Upcoming No Revokes</h2>
<p>
1. Serverless meaning your network packets aren’t tunneled to our servers. This both ensures complete privacy and speed.
2. Since it’s not a traditional VPN it will allow you to use other VPNs or DNS configurations without messing with the anti-revoke
3. If you want to install new apps you’ll get a pop up saying whether you want to temporarily disable the anti-revoke. This ensures once again that you stay in a non-revoked state. </p>

<h2>Why Us ?</h2>
<p>Scarlet offers a new community for developers to submit their paid apps and allow users to seemlessly protect themselves from revokes. Our goal getting into Scarlet is to give everybody access to a store that doesn't tell people to do the workarounds. Instead we created an app with every user in mind to bring a smooth experience.</p>
